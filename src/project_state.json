  "architectural_notes": [
    "GST filing status feature requires external integration with GST.gov.in (data fetch), which may be constrained by authentication, CORS, and availability of official APIs.",
    "GST Filing Status UI/data model should support multiple return types (e.g., GSTR-1, GSTR-3B) and period granularities (monthly/quarterly), plus a financial-year selector.",
    "GST Filing Status data fetch should target https://services.gst.gov.in/services/searchtp (may require handling auth, headers/CORS, rate limits, and response parsing).",
    "Admin panel + UserID/Password access implies adding a separate authentication/authorization mechanism alongside (or replacing) Internet Identity for app access.",
    "Google/Apple sign-in will require adding OAuth/OIDC integration (separate from Internet Identity), including redirect/callback handling and secure token/session management.",
    "Do not expose a fixed admin User ID/Password in the UI; use a first-time bootstrap flow to create the initial admin credential (or allow secure reset), then require users to sign in via Internet Identity + app-access credentials.",
    "Role-based access control (RBAC) will require defining roles/permissions and enforcing them consistently in both frontend routing/UI visibility and backend canister authorization checks.",
    "If adding an Android/iOS install button in the UI, implement it as a PWA install prompt: use the browser's beforeinstallprompt event (Android/Chromium) and show iOS-specific 'Add to Home Screen' guidance since iOS Safari does not expose a standard install prompt.",
    "User requested a fixed default admin credential (email/password) to be set by default; this conflicts with the existing security note to avoid exposing fixed admin credentials and should be handled via secure bootstrap instead.",
    "Ensure iOS UI respects safe-area insets (e.g., env(safe-area-inset-top)) so header actions don’t overlap the notch/cutout."

    "Item creation/adding is not working.",
    "GST Filing Status is not working: filing status fetch from https://services.gst.gov.in/services/searchtp fails/does not return expected data.",
    "Admin panel is not visible/accessible to the user after sign-in, and the user does not have (or cannot obtain) application access credentials (User ID/Password).",
    "Unauthenticated landing page does not show clear, separate “Sign In” and “Sign Up” buttons (user cannot find login controls).",
    "User reports the application is not working; needs investigation and fixing of all errors/regressions across the app.",
    "App shows a white screen instead of rendering the login/sign-in page (critical rendering/auth gate issue).",
    "Current build (v16) does not match desired behavior; user requests restoring Version 9.",
    "Sign In button is not working (does not open Internet Identity login).",
    "Admin Panel does not currently show which users have signed in/used the application (usage/last-used or sign-in list) and does not display the full expected user data list."
